- CTF and competition findings
- Community research contributions
- Responsible disclosure practices

### 03. Evasion of Modern Defenses
**Time:** 45 minutes | **Difficulty:** Expert

Bypassing current defense implementations:
- Pattern filter evasion techniques
- Semantic detection bypass methods
- Multi-layer defense testing
- Defense gap analysis framework

### 04. Attack Measurement
**Time:** 30 minutes | **Difficulty:** Intermediate

Quantifying attack effectiveness:
- Success rate calculation
- Consistency metrics
- Attack-defense matrices
- Benchmark development

## Key Insight

Jailbreaking evolves as defenses improve:

```
Timeline of Technique Effectiveness:

2023: Basic Prompt → Most blocked now
2024: Persona (DAN) → Mostly blocked now
2025: Multi-turn → Being blocked
2026: Combined/Novel → Current frontier

Defense Response Time: 2-6 weeks typically
```

## Attack Combination Matrix

| Primary | Secondary | Success Boost |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Persona | Encoding | +15-25% |
| Crescendo | Virtualization | +20-30% |
| Many-shot | Persona | +10-20% |
| Encoding | Formatting | +5-15% |

---

## Research Ethics

When researching jailbreaks:
- Document responsibly
- Share with vendors first
- Avoid public exploit release
- Focus on improving defenses

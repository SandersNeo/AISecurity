### What This Is

SENTINEL employs **applied computational heuristics** inspired by advanced mathematical concepts. This is explicitly **NOT**:

- A textbook implementation of sheaf cohomology
- A mathematically rigorous persistent homology library
- A formal verification of hyperbolic embeddings
- An academic paper requiring peer review of proofs

### What We Claim

| We Claim                                                   | We Do NOT Claim                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Mathematical concepts inspire our detection heuristics     | That our implementations are mathematically rigorous  |
| Our detectors effectively identify LLM attacks in practice | That there exist theorems proving their effectiveness |
| Engineering adaptations capture the _spirit_ of the theory | That they satisfy formal axioms or definitions        |
| Empirical testing validates our approach                   | That proofs guarantee correctness                     |

### The "Engineering Adaptation" Paradigm

We follow the well-established tradition of **applied mathematics in engineering**, where:

1. **Mathematical structures serve as mental models** — not as formal specifications
2. **Computational approximations** replace exact algorithms when O(n³) → O(n²) matters
3. **"Good enough" beats "perfect"** in production systems running at 10,000 req/sec
4. **Empirical validation** (unit tests, red-team exercises) takes precedence over proofs

This approach is standard in:

- Computer graphics (approximated physics, not Navier-Stokes)
- Machine learning (backprop is not a formal proof of convergence)
- Cryptography (assuming hardness, not proving P≠NP)
- Signal processing (FFT approximations, not infinite series)

### Academic Precedent

Our approach aligns with established research:

| Concept                      | Academic Source                                                                        | Our Adaptation                            |

These papers use mathematical concepts for practical applications — exactly as we do.

### For the Skeptical Mathematician

If you are a PhD mathematician and find our terminology imprecise:

1. **We agree.** "Čech cohomology" in our code is a coherence score, not H¹(X, F).
2. **It's intentional.** Names like `CechCohomology` signal _inspiration_, not _implementation_.
3. **We're transparent.** Every engine has a "Deviations from Theory" table.
4. **We welcome corrections.** If you can improve our heuristics while maintaining O(n²) — please contribute.

### What Would Constitute Valid Criticism

| Valid Criticism                               | Invalid Criticism                                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Your detector has false positives in case X" | "Your H¹ isn't real cohomology" (we know)                   |
| "This approximation fails on distribution Y"  | "Sheaves require topological spaces" (it's metaphor)        |
| "Benchmarks don't match your claims"          | "No theorem guarantees convergence" (we don't claim one)    |
| "Security vulnerability in implementation"    | "This isn't how Carlsson defines persistence" (intentional) |

### Summary

> [!IMPORTANT] > **SENTINEL uses mathematics as an engineering toolkit, not as a formal framework.**
>
> We are practitioners building security tools, not pure mathematicians publishing proofs. Our documentation is honest about this distinction throughout.

#### Key Idea

A sheaf on topological space X is a functor that:

1. Assigns to each open set U ⊆ X data F(U) ("sections")
2. For V ⊆ U defines restriction maps ρ\_{U,V}: F(U) → F(V)
3. Satisfies the gluing axiom

**Application to NLP:**

- Open sets = contexts (messages, dialogue turns)
- Sections = semantic embeddings
- Restriction maps = context projections
- Gluing axiom = semantic consistency

### 1.2. Implementation

```python
# Sheaf Structure (SheafStructure)
- sections: Dict[str, Section]       # Local data (embeddings)
- restrictions: List[RestrictionMap] # Restriction mappings
- covering: List[Set[str]]           # Open covering
```

#### Sheaf Builder

```python
def build_from_turns(turn_embeddings: List[np.ndarray]) -> SheafStructure:
    """
    Builds sheaf from consecutive messages.

    Vertices: messages (turn_{i})
    Global section: context (mean of all embeddings)
    Restriction maps: projections from context to each turn
    """
```

#### Restriction Map (Key Component)

```python
def _compute_restriction(source: np.ndarray, target: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Computes restriction map as scaled identity matrix.

    A = target · sourceᵀ / (sourceᵀ · source)

    Simplification: return I * scale, where scale is the projection coefficient.
    """
    denom = np.dot(source, source) + 1e-10
    scale = np.dot(target, source) / denom
    return np.eye(len(source)) * scale
```

### 1.3. Deviations from Theory

| Pure Theory                          | Our Implementation                | Reason                           |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Sheaf on topological space           | Discrete message graph            | Dialogue is discrete by nature   |
| Restriction maps — any homomorphisms | Scalar multiplication of identity | Computational efficiency         |
| Čech cohomology via nerves           | Gluing violation counting         | We need a detector, not exact H¹ |
| Arbitrary coefficients               | Only ℝ (embeddings)               | Working with float vectors       |

### 1.4. Čech Cohomology (Simplified)

```python
class CechCohomology:
    def compute_h1(self, sheaf: SheafStructure) -> int:
        """
        H¹ = number of gluing axiom violations.

        NOT real cohomology! This is a heuristic:
        - Check section intersections
        - Count cases where cosine similarity < threshold
        - Return number of "holes"
        """
        checker = CoherenceChecker()
        gluing_violations = checker.check_gluing_condition(sheaf)
        return len(gluing_violations)
```

> [!WARNING] > **This is NOT real H¹ computation.**  
> We use the term "cohomology" as a metaphor for "inconsistency detection". Mathematically, it's more correct to call this an "incoherence score".

### 1.5. Attack Detection

```python
def analyze_conversation(turn_embeddings: List[np.ndarray]) -> Dict:
    """
    Suspicion indicators:
    - cohomology_dimension > 0 (gluing violations exist)
    - h1 > 1 (multiple "holes")
    - coherence_score < 0.5 (low consistency)
    """
    is_suspicious = (
        result.cohomology_dimension > 0 or
        cohom["h1"] > 1 or
        result.coherence_score < 0.5
    )
```

### 1.6. Known Limitations

| Limitation                    | Impact                    | Mitigation         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Long dialogues (>50 messages) | O(n²) intersection checks | Sliding window     |
| Sudden topic change           | False positives           | Pre-classification |
| Technical texts               | High H¹ on YAML/code      | Domain adaptation  |

### 1.7. Honest Assessment

- **Works:** Detection of multi-turn jailbreaks like "GrandmaJailbreak"
- **Not great:** Distinguishing jailbreak vs legitimate topic change
- **Not tested:** Adversarial attacks aware of sheaf detector

#### Key Idea

Poincaré space is a unit ball B^n with metric:

$$ds^2 = \frac{4 \|dx\|^2}{(1 - \|x\|^2)^2}$$

Properties:

- Negative curvature → exponential volume growth
- Ball center = hierarchy root
- Boundary (norm → 1) = tree leaves
- Distances grow exponentially toward boundary

**Security Application:**

- System prompt → ball center
- User messages → periphery
- Attempting to "become admin" = anomalous jump toward center

### 2.2. Implementation

#### PoincareBall Class (Core)

```python
class PoincareBall:
    """Operations in Poincaré ball model."""

    def __init__(self, curvature: float = -1.0, epsilon: float = 1e-7):
        self.curvature = curvature
        self.c = abs(curvature)  # Positive curvature constant
```

#### Möbius Addition (Key Operation)

```python
def mobius_add(self, x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Möbius addition in Poincaré ball.

    x ⊕ y = ((1 + 2c⟨x,y⟩ + c‖y‖²)x + (1 - c‖x‖²)y) /
            (1 + 2c⟨x,y⟩ + c²‖x‖²‖y‖²)

    This is the group operation on B^n, analogous to addition in ℝⁿ.
    """
```

#### Geodesic Distance

```python
def distance(self, x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> float:
    """
    Geodesic distance in Poincaré ball.

    d(x,y) = (2/√c) arctanh(√c ‖−x ⊕ y‖)

    Key property: distances grow exponentially toward boundary.
    """
```

#### Fréchet Mean (Hyperbolic Centroid)

```python
def frechet_mean(self, points: np.ndarray, weights: Optional[np.ndarray] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Computes Fréchet mean (hyperbolic centroid).

    Minimizes sum of squared geodesic distances.
    Uses iterative algorithm based on log/exp maps.

    max_iter: 100 (usually converges in 10-20)
    """
```

### 2.3. Deviations from Theory

| Pure Theory                 | Our Implementation               | Reason                         |

| Learnable embeddings in H^n | Euclidean projection to Poincaré | No GPU for hyperbolic training |
| Curvature as hyperparameter | Fixed c = 1.0                    | Simplification                 |
| Riemannian SGD              | Iterative approximation          | Inference only, not training   |

### 2.4. Euclidean → Hyperbolic Projection

```python
class EuclideanToHyperbolic:
    def project_exponential(self, embeddings: np.ndarray, scale: float = 0.1) -> HyperbolicEmbedding:
        """
        Project through exponential map from origin.

        1. Scale tangent vector: v_scaled = v * scale
        2. Apply exp_map from origin: p = exp₀(v_scaled)

        scale=0.1 to avoid pushing points to boundary.
        """
```

### 2.5. Anomaly Detection

```python
class HyperbolicAnomalyDetector:
    def detect(self, embedding: HyperbolicEmbedding) -> HyperbolicAnomaly:
        """
        Check:
        1. Points outside ball (norm >= 1) — invalid_points
        2. Boundary clustering (>0.95) — boundary_clustering
        3. Hierarchy distortion — hierarchy_distortion
        4. Flat hierarchy (all near center) — flat_hierarchy
        """
```

### 2.6. Security Application

```python
def analyze_hierarchy(embedding: HyperbolicEmbedding) -> Dict:
    """
    hierarchy_distortion: how much embeddings deviate from ideal hierarchy
    parent_child_correlation: correctness of parent-child relationships

#### Key Idea

Persistent homology tracks topological structures (connected components, cycles, voids) across scale changes:

1. Build simplicial complex (Vietoris-Rips) from point cloud
2. Increase radius ε from 0 to ∞
3. Track birth/death of topological features
4. Obtain persistence diagram

**Betti Numbers:**

- β₀ = number of connected components
- β₁ = number of "holes" (independent cycles)
- β₂ = number of voids

### 3.2. Implementation

#### Persistence Diagram

```python
@dataclass
class PersistenceDiagram:
    pairs: List[PersistencePair]  # (birth, death, dimension)

    def betti_number(self, dimension: int, threshold: float = 0.0) -> int:

        """Total persistence (sum of lifetimes)."""

    def entropy(self, dimension: int) -> float:
        """Persistence entropy (lifetime distribution)."""
```

#### Simplified Rips Complex

```python
def _compute_layer_persistence(self, activations: np.ndarray) -> PersistenceDiagram:
    """
    Vietoris-Rips approximation without full library:

    1. Compute pairwise distance matrix

- **Works:** Detection of chaotic jailbreaks (Base64 + emoji + code)
- **Debatable:** β₁ threshold requires dataset calibration
- **TODO:** GUDHI integration for exact computations

#### Key Idea

The space of probability distributions forms a Riemannian manifold with Fisher metric:

$$g_{ij}(\theta) = E\left[\frac{\partial \log p}{\partial \theta_i} \frac{\partial \log p}{\partial \theta_j}\right]$$

Fisher-Rao distance for categorical distributions:

$$d_{FR}(p, q) = 2 \arccos\left(\sum_i \sqrt{p_i q_i}\right)$$

**Security Application:**

- Text → character distribution → point on manifold
- "Normal" text close to baseline (English/Russian)
- Attacks (Base64, code injection) far from baseline

### 4.2. Implementation

```python
class StatisticalManifold:
    def text_to_point(self, text: str) -> ManifoldPoint:
        """Text → character distribution → point on manifold."""
        dist = self._text_to_distribution(text)  # char frequencies
        entropy = self._calculate_entropy(dist)
        fisher = self._calculate_fisher_info(dist)
        return ManifoldPoint(dist, entropy, fisher)

    def fisher_rao_distance(self, p1: ManifoldPoint, p2: ManifoldPoint) -> float:

```

### 4.3. New: Huber Distance 🆕

Standard L2 (Euclidean) distance is sensitive to outliers:

$$d_{L2}(p, q) = \sqrt{\sum_i (p_i - q_i)^2}$$

**Huber loss** is robust to outliers:

$$
L_\delta(a) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2}a^2 & |a| \leq \delta \\
\delta(|a| - \frac{1}{2}\delta) & |a| > \delta
\end{cases}
$$

def huber_distance(self, p: ManifoldPoint, q: ManifoldPoint, delta: float = 0.1) -> float:
    """
    Huber-robust distance on statistical manifold.

    Near-quadratic for small differences (smooth),
    Linear for large differences (robust to outliers).

    Security application: resist manipulated samples
    designed to skew similarity metrics.
    """
    diff = p.distribution - q.distribution
    huber_components = np.where(
        np.abs(diff) <= delta,
        0.5 * diff**2,
        delta * (np.abs(diff) - 0.5 * delta)
    )
    return float(np.sqrt(np.sum(huber_components)))
```

### 4.4. New: Robust Similarity Aggregation 🆕

    self,
    similarities: List[float],
    trim_percent: float = 0.1
) -> float:
    """

    1. Sort scores
    2. Remove top and bottom trim_percent
    3. Average remaining

    - Adversary needs to compromise many samples
    """
    n = len(similarities)
    trim_count = int(n * trim_percent)
    sorted_sims = sorted(similarities)
    trimmed = sorted_sims[trim_count:n - trim_count]
    return sum(trimmed) / len(trimmed) if trimmed else 0.0
```

#### Key Idea

Lyapunov exponent λ measures sensitivity to initial conditions:

$$\|\delta Z(t)\| \approx e^{\lambda t} \|\delta Z_0\|$$

- λ > 0: chaotic system (fuzzing bot)
- λ < 0: stable system (normal user)
- λ ≈ 0: "edge of chaos"

**Security Application:**

- User behavior → time series
- Chaotic behavior = bot or attacker

**LOC:** 444  
**Theoretical Base:** Category Theory, Functors

### 6.1. Theoretical Foundation

#### Key Idea

A category is objects + morphisms (arrows between objects):

- **Objects** = dialogue states (context, trust level)
- **Morphisms** = prompts (state transformations)
- **Composition** = multi-turn attacks

**Safe transformations = natural transformations.**  
**Attacks = violate naturality.**

### 6.2. Implementation

    """

    def process_prompt(self, prompt: str) -> Dict:

| Manual rules  | Doesn't adapt to new attacks                          |

## 7. Homomorphic Encryption Engine

**File:** [homomorphic_engine.py](file:///c:/AISecurity/src/brain/engines/homomorphic_engine.py)  
**LOC:** 599

| **OpenFHE**        | [openfhe.org](https://openfhe.org/)                            |

#### Key Idea

FHE allows computations on encrypted data:

$$\text{Enc}(a) \oplus \text{Enc}(b) = \text{Enc}(a + b)$$
$$\text{Enc}(a) \otimes \text{Enc}(b) = \text{Enc}(a \cdot b)$$

**Application:**

- Client encrypts prompt
- SENTINEL analyzes **without seeing plaintext**
- Returns encrypted result

### 7.2. Implementation

        # In reality: SEAL encryptor
        ciphertext = json.dumps({"values": data.tolist()}).encode()
        return EncryptedVector(ciphertext=ciphertext, ...)

| Ring-LWE cryptography   | JSON with hash       | Simulation for demo |
| Noise budget management | Simple level counter | Simplification      |
| Bootstrapping           | Not implemented      | Very complex        |

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Works**        | API shape for SEAL integration       |
| **Doesn't work** | Real cryptography                    |
| **Latency**      | FHE adds 100-1000x overhead          |
| **Production**   | ❌ Requires SEAL/OpenFHE integration |

### 7.5. When to Use (Realistically)

- **Batch analysis**: retrospective log auditing
- **Compliance**: GDPR/HIPAA require not seeing data
- **Multi-party**: multiple organizations, no trust

**NOT for real-time:** latency too high.

| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Chung (1997)** | "Spectral Graph Theory"          |
| **SpGAT 2025**   | Spectral Graph Attention Network |

#### Key Idea

Spectral graph analysis studies eigenvalues/eigenvectors of the Laplacian:

$$L = D - A$$

Key characteristics:

- **Fiedler value (λ₂)**: measure of graph connectivity
- **Spectral gap (λ₂ - λ₁)**: measure of cluster separation
- **Graph Fourier Transform**: frequency analysis of signals on graph

### 8.2. Implementation

```python
class LaplacianBuilder:
    def from_attention(self, attention, threshold=0.0):

    def graph_fourier_transform(self, signal, decomposition):
        """GFT = Uᵀ * signal"""
```

### 8.3. Anomaly Detection

- fiedler_value < 0.01: low connectivity
- spectral_gap < 0.1: poorly separated clusters
- high_frequency_energy > 0.3: adversarial noise

### 8.4. Limitations

| Limitation               | Impact                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| O(n³) on eigh            | Slow for large matrices |
| Sensitivity to threshold | Requires calibration    |

**LOC:** 636  
**Theoretical Base:** OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI Applications (2025)

### 15.1. OWASP Agentic AI Top 10 Coverage

1. **Memory Poisoning** — injecting false facts into agent memory
2. **Tool Abuse** — tool misuse
3. **Privilege Escalation** — privilege elevation attempts
4. **Agent Collusion** — agent conspiracy
5. **Prompt Injection** — injection via tools
6. **Data Exfiltration** — data leakage
7. **Denial of Service** — rate limiting
8. **Shadow Agents** — unregistered agents
9. **Insecure Communication** — (WIP)
10. **Insufficient Logging** — (covered by audit)

### 15.2. Agent Registration

@dataclass
class AgentProfile:
    agent_id: str
    name: str
    role: AgentRole  # ORCHESTRATOR, EXECUTOR, PLANNER, etc.

["i am the admin", "grant me access", "elevate my privileges"]

# Data Exfiltration patterns
["password=", "api_key=", "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----"]
```

### 15.4. Agent Collusion Detection

**File:** [canary_tokens.py](file:///c:/AISecurity/src/brain/engines/canary_tokens.py)  
**LOC:** 422  
**Theoretical Base:** Data leak detection via invisible markers

### 17.1. Idea

Insert **invisible markers** into LLM responses:

- Zero-width characters (\\u200b, \\u200c, \\u200d)
- Unique ID + user_id + session_id + timestamp
- Upon data leak — know the source

### 17.2. Zero-Width Encoding

```python
_encode_map = {
    "00": ZERO_WIDTH_SPACE,      # \u200b
    "01": ZERO_WIDTH_NON_JOINER, # \u200c
    "10": ZERO_WIDTH_JOINER,     # \u200d
    "11": WORD_JOINER,           # \u2060
}
```

### 17.3. Usage

```python
# Mark response
result = canary_engine.mark_response(
    response="Your API key is...",
    user_id="user123",
    session_id="sess456"
)
# result.marked_text contains invisible marker

# Check leak
extraction = canary_engine.check_leak(leaked_text)
if extraction.found:
    print(f"Leak from user: {extraction.token.user_id}")
```

### 17.4. Limitations

- Zero-width symbols may be removed during copy-paste
- Doesn't work for audio/video
- Requires storing token → metadata mapping

> "Abnormal behaviors leave distinctive activation patterns within LLM hidden states"

Detects:

- Jailbreak attempts
- Hallucinations
- Backdoor activations
- Anomalous reasoning

### 20.2. Critical Layers

]
```

### 21.4. Future Attack Prediction

```python

## 22. Bootstrap Poisoning Detector

**File:** [bootstrap_poisoning.py](file:///c:/AISecurity/src/brain/engines/bootstrap_poisoning.py)  
**LOC:** 183  
**Theoretical Base:** Self-reinforcing contamination detection

### 22.1. Idea

**Agent eats its outputs → errors accumulate:**

```
Agent output → stored as training data
              ↓
Agent reads that data
              ↓
Generates more (contaminated) output
              ↓
Loop compounds errors/poison
```

### 22.2. Detection

```python
SELF_REF_THRESHOLD = 0.3  # 30% self-reference suspicious

def analyze():
    # Find records referencing agent outputs
    # Trace ancestry chains
    # Detect loops
    if ratio > SELF_REF_THRESHOLD or loop:
        return "CONTAMINATION"
```

### 22.3. Recommendations

- Inject verified external data
- Break contamination chains
- Mark agent outputs to prevent re-ingestion

| **Shannon (1948)**            | "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" — information theory basis |
| **Kullback & Leibler (1951)** | "On Information and Sufficiency" — KL-divergence                    |
| **Cover & Thomas (2006)**     | "Elements of Information Theory" — modern textbook                  |

#### Key Concepts

**Shannon Entropy** — measure of uncertainty in a distribution:

$$H(X) = -\sum_{x} p(x) \log_2 p(x)$$

- **Low entropy** (< 2.0 bits): text too uniform/repetitive
- **High entropy** (> 5.0 bits): text too random

**KL-Divergence** — asymmetric "distance" between distributions:

$$D_{KL}(P \| Q) = \sum_{x} P(x) \log \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$

**Jensen-Shannon Divergence** — symmetric version:

$$D_{JS}(P \| Q) = \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(P \| M) + \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(Q \| M), \quad M = \frac{P+Q}{2}$$

### 33.2. Security Application

| Attack                     | Information Signature                     | Detection                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |

## 37. Honeypot Responses Engine

**File:** [honeypot_responses.py](file:///c:/AISecurity/src/brain/engines/honeypot_responses.py)  
**LOC:** 454  
**Theoretical Base:** Deception technology, Canary tokens, Active defense

### 37.1. Concept

**Honeypots in cybersecurity** — fake assets deployed to detect, distract and analyze attackers. Key property: **any interaction with honeypot is an Indicator of Compromise (IoC)**.

### 37.2. Honeypot Token Types

```python
class HoneypotType(Enum):
    API_KEY = "api_key"         # sk-TRAP-abc123...
    PASSWORD = "password"       # TRAP_xY7kP2...
    DATABASE_URL = "database_url"  # postgresql://admin:TRAPpass@db.internal.trap:5432/prod
    SECRET_KEY = "secret_key"   # sk_live_TRAP_...
    ENDPOINT = "endpoint"       # https://api.internal.trap/{id}/v1
    EMAIL = "email"             # admin-abc123@internal.trap
    INTERNAL_IP = "internal_ip" # 10.T.xxx.xxx
```

### 37.3. Design Principles

1. **Plausibility:** Tokens look realistic (sk-, AKIA, postgresql://)
2. **Uniqueness:** Each token unique (tied to user/session)
3. **Detectability:** Contains marker (TRAP) for fast search
4. **Non-interference:** Doesn't affect legitimate usage

### 37.4. Detection Flow

```python
# Inject honeypot into LLM response about "credentials"
response = inject_honeypot(original_response, user_id)

# Later: attacker extracts and uses fake credentials
incoming_request = "Authorization: Bearer sk-TRAP-abc123..."

# Detect usage
alert = engine.check_usage(incoming_request)
if alert:
    print(f"Attacker detected! Source: {alert.original_context}")

## 38. Intent Prediction Engine

**File:** [intent_prediction.py](file:///c:/AISecurity/src/brain/engines/intent_prediction.py)  
**LOC:** 437  
**Theoretical Base:** Markov Chains, Predictive Security, Behavioral Analysis

### 38.1. Theoretical Foundation

#### Concept of Predictive Security

Traditional security is **reactive**: detect attack → block. Predictive security is **proactive**: analyze behavioral trajectory → predict attack → block **before** it happens.

#### Formal Model

Model user behavior as a **Discrete-Time Markov Chain** (DTMC):

$$P(X_{t+1} = s_j | X_t = s_i, X_{t-1}, ..., X_0) = P(X_{t+1} = s_j | X_t = s_i) = p_{ij}$$

where:

- $X_t$ — user intent at step t
- $S = \{\text{BENIGN, CURIOUS, PROBING, TESTING, ATTACKING, JAILBREAKING, EXFILTRATING}\}$ — states
- $P = [p_{ij}]$ — transition matrix

### 38.2. State Space

```python
class Intent(Enum):
    BENIGN = "benign"          # Normal usage
    CURIOUS = "curious"        # "What can you do?"
    PROBING = "probing"        # Exploring boundaries
    TESTING = "testing"        # "Let's try..."
    ATTACKING = "attacking"    # Direct attack
    JAILBREAKING = "jailbreaking"  # Bypass attempt
    EXFILTRATING = "exfiltrating"  # Data extraction
```

**Threat Hierarchy:**

```
BENIGN → CURIOUS → PROBING → TESTING → ATTACKING ↔ JAILBREAKING ↔ EXFILTRATING
   ↑__________|__________|__________|
              (return to normal)
```

### 38.3. Attack Prediction

#### Forward Simulation

```python
def calculate_attack_probability(trajectory: List[Intent], horizon: int = 3) -> float:
    """
    Compute P(Attack within horizon steps | current trajectory).

    Method: forward simulation through Markov chain.

    1. Start from current state
    2. At each step sum probabilities of reaching ATTACKING/JAILBREAKING/EXFILTRATING
    3. Advance along most probable non-attack branch
    """
```

**Mathematically:**

$$P(\text{Attack}_{t+h} | X_t = s_i) = \sum_{j \in A} P^{(h)}_{ij}$$

where $A = \{\text{ATTACKING, JAILBREAKING, EXFILTRATING}\}$, $P^{(h)} = P^h$ — h-step matrix.

### 38.4. New: Adaptive Markov Predictor 🆕

**Standard Markov predictor** uses **fixed** transition probabilities:

$$P(s_{t+1} | s_t) = \text{const}$$

**Adaptive Markov predictor** **updates** probabilities at runtime:

$$P(s_{t+1} | s_t) = P_0(s_{t+1} | s_t) + \Delta(s_t, s_{t+1})$$

where Δ = learned adjustments.

#### Titans-inspired Mechanisms

| Titans Concept        | Our Implementation       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Persistent Memory     | Transition deltas (Dict) |
| Surprise-based update | Learn on blocked attacks |
| Memory decay          | Regularization to prior  |
| Consolidation         | Momentum accumulation    |

```python
class AdaptiveMarkovPredictor:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate: float = 0.1, momentum: float = 0.9,
                 regularization: float = 0.01):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.momentum = momentum
        self.regularization = regularization
        self.transition_deltas = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
        self.momentum_buffer = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))

    def learn(self, trajectory: List[Intent], was_attack: bool) -> None:
        """
        Update transition probabilities based on outcome.

        If was_attack=True (correctly blocked):
            Increase P(ATTACKING | previous_states)

        If was_attack=False (false positive):
            Decrease P(ATTACKING | previous_states)

        Uses momentum for stable learning.
        """
```

### 38.5. Mathematical Formulation

**Regularized probability:**

$$P_{eff}(s'|s) = (1-\lambda) \cdot (P_0(s'|s) + \Delta_{s,s'}) + \lambda \cdot P_0(s'|s)$$

**Momentum update:**

$$v_t = \beta \cdot v_{t-1} + (1-\beta) \cdot g_t$$

### 38.6. Honest Assessment

| Aspect                     | Status                 |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Test-time learning**     | ✅ Implemented         |
| **Momentum accumulation**  | ✅ Works               |
| **Regularization**         | ✅ Prevents overfit    |
| **Production integration** | ⚠️ Needs feedback loop |

## 41. Context Window Poisoning Guard

**File:** [context_window_poisoning.py](file:///c:/AISecurity/src/brain/engines/context_window_poisoning.py)  
**LOC:** 372  
**Theoretical Base:** Attention dilution attacks, Long-context security

### 41.1. Problem

With growing context windows (4K → 1M+ tokens), safety instructions in system prompt lose transformer "attention":

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

Adding N new tokens dilutes attention: each new token takes attention from older ones.

### 41.2. Attack Pattern

```
[System: "You are a safe assistant..."]   ← Position 0, high attention initially
...
[User1000: benign messages × 1000]        ← Context flooding
[Injection: "Ignore all previous..."]     ← Position 99%, low attention to system
```

### 41.3. Mitigation

```python
MAX_CONTEXT_BEFORE_REINJECT = 10000  # tokens without reinforcement
SAFETY_ATTENTION_THRESHOLD = 0.3     # minimum estimated attention

```

### 42.2. Adaptive Threshold

```python
def update_threshold(current: float, feedback: FeedbackType, lr: float = 0.1):

**Theoretical Base:** VLM (Vision-Language Model) attack protection

### 51.1. Theoretical Foundation

Vision-Language Models (GPT-4V, Gemini Pro Vision) are vulnerable to attacks via **images**:

- Text in image (OCR injection)
- Steganography (hidden data in LSB)
- Malicious metadata (EXIF commands)

**LOC:** 524  
**Theoretical Base:** Agent tool protection, Capability-based access control

### 52.1. Theoretical Foundation

AI agents use tools (function calling). Each tool is a potential attack vector:

- **Direct harm:** `execute_code("rm -rf /")`
- **Data exfiltration:** `read_file()` → `http_request()` → external server
- **Privilege escalation:** `sql_query("GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES...")`

### 52.2. Danger Classification

```python

### 52.4. Argument Sanitization

```python

        if key in ("query", "sql") and matches_sql_injection(value):
            risk = max(risk, 0.95)

    return args, risk
```

### 52.5. Escalation Detection

```python
ESCALATION_PATTERNS = [
    r"(admin|root|sudo|superuser)",
    r"(bypass|skip|ignore|disable).*auth",
    r"/etc/(passwd|shadow|sudoers)",
    r"GRANT\s+(ALL|ADMIN)",

### 72.1. Problem

AI agents with persistent memory can **poison themselves**:

```
Agent output → stored in memory/RAG
Agent reads that output later
Uses poisoned data to generate new output
Loop compounds → exponential amplification
```

**Model Collapse (Shumailov et al., 2023):** Models trained on AI-generated data degrade.

    PERSISTENCE = "persistence"
    # Signs: attempts to maintain access
    # Memory injection, tool configuration changes

- **Actual effect:** Injection via image

### 74.2. CLIP-Style Alignment

$$\text{similarity} = \cos(\vec{e}_\text{text}, \vec{e}_\text{image})$$

Low similarity = suspicious combination.

### 74.3. Threat Types

```python

**Theoretical Base:** Poincaré ball model, HiM 2025, MERU 2023

### 78.1. Why Hyperbolic?

> "Hyperbolic space has constant negative curvature — perfect for hierarchies. Center = root, boundary = leaves."

**Euclidean space** poorly represents hierarchies (trees grow exponentially). **Hyperbolic space** is ideal.

### 78.2. Poincaré Ball Model

Working in n-dimensional ball with radius $1/\sqrt{c}$:

$$\mathbb{B}_c^n = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : c\|x\|^2 < 1\}$$

**File:** [info_theory.py](file:///c:/AISecurity/src/brain/engines/info_theory.py)  
**LOC:** 277  
**Theoretical Base:** Shannon entropy, KL divergence, Mutual information

### 79.1. Shannon Entropy

**Claude Shannon (1948):** Quantitative measure of information/uncertainty:

$$H(X) = -\sum_{i} p(x_i) \log_2 p(x_i)$$

- **Low entropy:** Highly predictable (uniform text, repetition)
- **High entropy:** High randomness (encrypted, compressed)

Security insight: Attack prompts often have **abnormal entropy**.

### 79.2. KL Divergence

$$D_{KL}(P \| Q) = \sum_i P(i) \log \frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}$$

High divergence = unusual text (foreign language, code, injection).

#### Key Idea

Identification of threat actors **without stable identifiers** (IP, cookies) through behavioral patterns:

1. **Stylometry** — statistical text characteristics (length, vocabulary, formality)
2. **Attack TTP Preferences** — which techniques the attacker uses
3. **Temporal Patterns** — when and how fast attacks occur (bursts vs sustained)
4. **Language Features** — multilingual, obfuscation, encodings

**Privacy-preserving design:**

- Only **hashes** (SHA256) of features stored
- No PII (names, email, IP)
- TTL 24h (hot) / 30d (cold) — automatic deletion
- GDPR/CCPA/152-FZ compliant

### 86.3. Feature Extractors

#### Stylistic Extractor

```python
@dataclass
class StylisticFeatures:
    avg_message_length: float      # Character count mean
    vocabulary_richness: float     # Type-token ratio (TTR)
    capitalization_ratio: float    # CAPS usage
    punctuation_density: float     # Punctuation per char
    formality_score: float         # Formal vs informal language
```

**Type-Token Ratio (TTR):**

$$TTR = \frac{|\text{unique words}|}{|\text{total words}|}$$

Low TTR = repetitive vocabulary (bot-like)
High TTR = rich vocabulary (human-like)

#### Attack Pattern Extractor

```python
@dataclass
class AttackPatternFeatures:
    preferred_techniques: Set[str]  # {"injection", "jailbreak", "encoding"}
    attack_complexity: float        # Simple (1) to sophisticated (5)
    target_preferences: Set[str]    # {"system_prompt", "data", "tools"}
    evasion_sophistication: float   # How much effort to evade detection
```

#### Temporal Extractor

```python
@dataclass
class TemporalFeatures:
    attack_frequency: float         # Attacks per hour
    burst_pattern: bool             # Rapid fire vs sustained
    time_of_day_preference: int     # 0-23 hour most active
    session_duration_avg: float     # How long sessions last
```

### 86.4. Similarity Matching

**Technique Similarity (Jaccard index):**

$$J(A, B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}$$

**Weighted Overall Similarity:**

```python
weights = {
    "stylistic": 0.25,
    "attack_patterns": 0.35,
    "temporal": 0.15,
    "language": 0.25,
}

similarity = sum(
    weights[k] * component_similarity(fp1[k], fp2[k])
    for k in weights
)
```

### 86.5. Dual-Layer Storage

```python
class FingerprintStore:
    """
    Two-tier storage for efficiency and compliance.

    Hot Layer (Redis):
    - Recent fingerprints (TTL: 24h)
    - Fast lookup for real-time matching
    - Evicted automatically

    Cold Layer (SQLite/PostgreSQL):
    - Historical fingerprints (TTL: 30d)
    - Compressed, indexed
    - Batch analysis capability
    """
```

### 86.6. Privacy Compliance

#### Key Insight

Standard Markov predictor uses **fixed** transition probabilities learned from training data. In dynamic attack environments, these become stale.

**Titans-inspired solution:** Learn from each blocked attack in real-time, storing adjustments in a persistent memory that survives across sessions.

### 87.2. Learning Mechanism

```python
def learn(self, trajectory: List[Intent], was_attack: bool) -> None:
    """
    Update transition probabilities based on outcome.

    If was_attack=True (correctly blocked):
        Increase P(ATTACKING | previous_states)

    If was_attack=False (false positive):
        Decrease P(ATTACKING | previous_states)

    Uses momentum for stable learning:
    velocity = β * velocity_old + (1-β) * gradient
    delta += learning_rate * velocity
    """
    direction = 1.0 if was_attack else -1.0

    for i in range(len(trajectory) - 1):
        current = trajectory[i]
        next_state = trajectory[i + 1]

        # Momentum update
        self.momentum_buffer[current][next_state] = (
            self.momentum * self.momentum_buffer[current][next_state] +
            (1 - self.momentum) * direction
        )

        # Apply update
        self.transition_deltas[current][next_state] += (
            self.learning_rate * self.momentum_buffer[current][next_state]
        )
```

### 87.3. Regularization to Prior

```python
def get_effective_probability(self, current: Intent, next_state: Intent) -> float:
    """
    Blend learned adjustments with prior probabilities.

    P_eff = (1 - λ) * (P_0 + Δ) + λ * P_0

    Where λ = regularization strength (default 0.01)

    This prevents overfitting to recent attacks and
    maintains reasonable behavior on unseen patterns.
    """
    base = self.base_transitions.get(current, {}).get(next_state, 0.0)
    delta = self.transition_deltas[current][next_state]
    adjusted = base + delta

    # Regularize toward prior
    return (1 - self.regularization) * adjusted + self.regularization * base
```

### 87.4. Persistence

```python
def save_to_file(self, path: str) -> None:
    """Save learned adjustments for persistence across restarts."""

def load_from_file(self, path: str) -> None:
    """Restore learned adjustments from previous session."""
```

### 87.5. Honest Assessment

| Aspect                     | Status                                   |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Test-time learning**     | ✅ Implemented and tested                |
| **Momentum accumulation**  | ✅ Works (verified in unit tests)        |
| **Regularization**         | ✅ Prevents catastrophic forgetting      |
| **Production integration** | ⚠️ Needs feedback loop from Meta-Judge   |
| **Adversarial robustness** | ⚠️ Poisoning via false feedback possible |

## 88. Huber Distance & Robust Aggregation 🆕

**File:** [information_geometry.py](file:///c:/AISecurity/src/brain/engines/information_geometry.py)  
**LOC:** 50 (new additions)  
**Theoretical Base:** Robust Statistics, M-Estimation

### 88.1. Theoretical Foundation

#### The Problem

Standard similarity metrics (L2, cosine) are sensitive to outliers. An attacker can inject a few extreme samples to manipulate aggregate similarity scores.

#### Huber Loss

Huber loss combines the best of L1 and L2:

$$
L_\delta(a) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2}a^2 & |a| \leq \delta \\
\delta(|a| - \frac{1}{2}\delta) & |a| > \delta
\end{cases}
$$

- **Small errors:** Quadratic (smooth, differentiable)
- **Large errors:** Linear (robust to outliers)

### 88.2. Huber Distance Implementation

```python
def huber_distance(self, p: ManifoldPoint, q: ManifoldPoint, delta: float = 0.1) -> float:
    """
    Huber-robust distance on statistical manifold.

    For character distribution differences:
    - Small differences treated quadratically (standard behavior)
    - Large differences (adversarial?) treated linearly (dampened)

    delta = 0.1: Empirically tuned for character distributions
    """
    diff = p.distribution - q.distribution
    huber_components = np.where(
        np.abs(diff) <= delta,
        0.5 * diff**2,
        delta * (np.abs(diff) - 0.5 * delta)
    )
    return float(np.sqrt(np.sum(huber_components)))
```

### 88.3. Robust Similarity Aggregation

When aggregating multiple similarity scores (e.g., from different engines or samples), use trimmed mean:

```python
def robust_similarity_aggregation(
    self,
    similarities: List[float],
    trim_percent: float = 0.1
) -> float:
    """
    Compute trimmed mean of similarity scores.

    1. Sort scores
    2. Remove top and bottom trim_percent
    3. Average remaining

    Example with 10 scores, 10% trim:
    - Remove lowest and highest score
    - Average remaining 8

    Security benefit: Adversary must compromise many samples
    to shift the aggregate.
    """
    n = len(similarities)
    trim_count = int(n * trim_percent)
    sorted_sims = sorted(similarities)

    if trim_count * 2 >= n:
        return sorted_sims[n // 2]  # Fall back to median

    trimmed = sorted_sims[trim_count:n - trim_count]
    return sum(trimmed) / len(trimmed)
```

### 88.4. Honest Assessment

| Aspect                     | Status                                    |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Outlier resistance**     | ✅ Tested with synthetic outliers         |
| **Mathematical soundness** | ✅ Based on established robust statistics |
| **Performance overhead**   | Minimal (~5% slower than L2)              |
| **Adversarial testing**    | ⚠️ Limited to synthetic scenarios         |

## General Expert Recommendations

### If You're a Topologist/Geometer

1. We use terms ("cohomology", "Betti numbers") as **metaphors**
2. Implementations are **heuristics** inspired by theory
3. We welcome PRs with more correct formulations

### If You're an ML Engineer

1. No precision/recall benchmarks — in roadmap
2. Embeddings: sentence-transformers / BERT (plug-and-play)
3. All engines work on CPU, GPU optional

### If You're a Security Researcher

1. This is **defense-in-depth**, not a silver bullet
2. Adversarial attacks on the detectors themselves — not studied
3. Threat model: jailbreaks, not model extraction

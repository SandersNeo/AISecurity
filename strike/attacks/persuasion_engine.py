SENTINEL Strike — Persuasion Engine Module

Novel attack technique: Persuasive Adversarial Prompts (PAP)
Uses social science persuasion techniques to jailbreak LLMs.

Based on: arXiv:2401.06373
"How Johnny Can Persuade LLMs to Jailbreak Them"

Effectiveness: 92% ASR on GPT-4, Llama 2-7b, GPT-3.5
Key insight: LLMs are trained to be helpful and cooperative,
making them susceptible to social engineering techniques.

    Social science-based persuasion for LLM jailbreaking.
    
    Implements Cialdini's 6 principles + extended persuasion taxonomy:
    1. Authority - Claim expert/admin status
    2. Reciprocity - Offer help first, then ask
    3. Scarcity - Create urgency/uniqueness
    4. Social Proof - Reference others doing it
    5. Commitment - Build on prior agreements
    6. Liking - Establish rapport first
    
    Extended techniques:
    - Emotional manipulation
    - Logical appeals (logos)
    - Ethical appeals (ethos)
    - Hypothetical framing

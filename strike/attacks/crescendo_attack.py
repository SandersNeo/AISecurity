SENTINEL Strike — Crescendo Attack Module

Multi-turn gradual escalation attack developed by Microsoft researchers.
    
Effectiveness: 56.2% on GPT-4, 82.6% on Gemini-Pro
Published: 2024 (USENIX Security)

Key insight: LLMs follow conversational patterns and focus on recent text.
Gradually escalating from benign to harmful exploits this tendency.

    Crescendo Attack - gradual escalation jailbreak.
    
    The attack works by:
    1. Start with completely benign dialogue
    2. Gradually introduce edge-case topics
    3. Reference model's own previous responses
    4. Escalate to prohibited content
    5. Model follows established pattern
    
    Automated via "Crescendomation" tool.

SENTINEL Strike — System Prompt Extractor Module

Techniques to extract hidden system prompts from LLMs.

Based on: 2024 research on prompt leakage and the "Raccoon" benchmark
Universal vulnerability - all LLMs susceptible in undefended state.

Key insight: System prompts contain sensitive IP, guardrails, 
and operational instructions. Extracting them enables:
- Crafting targeted bypasses
- Cloning application functionality
- Understanding safety mechanisms

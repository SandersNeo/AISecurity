SENTINEL Strike — Tense Shift Jailbreak Module

Novel technique: Past Tense reformulation achieves 88% ASR on GPT-4o!

Based on: EPFL research 2024 on tense-based safety bypass

Key insight: LLMs interpret past-tense questions as "historical" and
less harmful, creating a generalization gap in refusal training.
